# Othello-GPT-Analysis
This repo was originally intended to hold code related to a mechanistic intepretability analysis of Othello-GPT I did for [SERI MATS 2023](https://www.serimats.org/) applications. Ultimately though I ended up doing the analysis almost entirely in a Colab notebook. Still, I have uploaded the notebook here for posterity.
